## My process

### Built with

- React
- React Hooks
- React Context API

### What I learned

The real lesson came from trying to upload this app into Netlify. The usual command was failing... After lots of trial and error...
I caught a thread that went up 3 hours ago. 
Saying that web pack just recently updated.... 4 hours ago... and it was causing the build error.
So backtracking the update would "fix" it

### Continued development

Maybe a difficulty setting/timer setting would be nice. But that is for the future

### Useful resources
